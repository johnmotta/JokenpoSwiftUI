# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in SwiftUI
This is a project developed as a knowledge test in SwiftUI, using the 
technique of test-driven development (TDD). The goal was to create a 
functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game to demonstrate skills in Swift 
programming, the use of SwiftUI, and TDD.

The game allows you to play against the machine, selecting your move for 
each round and seeing the result immediately. The available moves are 
rock, paper, or scissors. The game has a point counter for each player and 
ends after 10 rounds, displaying a winner.

## Requirements
To run the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in SwiftUI, it is necessary to have 
Xcode installed on a Mac with the latest operating system. The project was 
developed using Xcode 14.3.1 and SwiftUI 5.

## Installation
To install the game, simply clone the repository and open the project in 
Xcode. No external dependencies are required.

## Contributions
This project was developed as a knowledge test and is not being actively 
maintained. Contributions are not expected at this time.
